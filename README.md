## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

I'm working on a better understanding of CSS. I believe I learned I have much to learn. 
This is my first time using media queries. 

### Continued development

Here I have questions more than actual development ideas.
- I tested on Chrome and did my best there. After I was finished, I looked at it on Firefox and Microsoft Edge, and it's terrible on those two. Why so different? How do I keep that from happening? 
- In Chrome, the vertical layout of the right-hand side doesn't stretch out over the entire section. I have no idea how to fix that.
